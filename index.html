						<i>Fox News - It's no secret that residents in <span class="regionName"></span> overpay for
							electricity because the power companies have a monopoly over them. This genius new invention
							will save you up to thousands of dollars a year off your electric bill. </i>
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p> Josh, the genius CEO behind a renouned solar company has been the talk of the town lately. <b>His
						most recent controversy is a genius electricity saving invention for those who can't afford
						fancy, expensive solar panels. </b>The electric power companies are furious and want Josh's
					money saving invention banned before the American public can take full advantage of the savings.
				</p>
				<p>He goes on to say <b>"The big power companies are scamming you.</b> Yes, that's right. Believe it or
					not, they have been using a secret to cheat you every time you run your lights, dishwasher, blender,
					vacuum and anything else that draws power. This is why your power bill is so expensive every month
					and keeps rising with some <b>
						<span class="regionName"></span> residents paying as much as $500 a month </b> in electric
					bills. Every American can slash their electricity bill by 90% using this revolutionary technology.
					You're welcome, America." </p>
				<div class="img">

					</a>
					<b> Pictured: Our readers old bill vs. new bill after using Josh's invention.</b>
				</div>
				<p>How bad is this little known scam? A new study reports that together <b>Americans overpay up to $27.6
						billion dollars a year</b> on their electric bill due to this! </p>
				<p>But for Josh, this was more than just an invention to fight back against the greedy electric
					companies. <b>When tragedy struck the Solar Plant, he knew he had to take action. Dorothy Smith was
						a 64 year old employee who died of a heat stroke after falling behind on her electric bills and
						her service was shut off in the middle of a record breaking heat wave. Her youngest daughter
						came to check up on her after many unanswered phone calls and tragically found Dorothy lifeless
						on the couch with her husband. </b>
				</p>
				<p>"The heat just got her. She had no power, no air conditioning, can you imagine? She was very prideful
					and ashamed to ask for help. <b>No one knew she fell behind and couldn't afford to pay for the high
						electric bills anymore.</b> She was always a very active person, always around the house,
					nothing could stop her." <b>Tragedies like this can happen to any American family as they ask
						themselves every month should I buy groceries to eat or pay my $400 electric bill to keep the
						lights on? Dorothy's story is every American's story. We dedicate this report in her loving
						memory.</b>
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<img src="img4.png" style="width:100%;height:auto">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p></p>
				<p>"This tragedy shook up the solar plant as they mourned their fallen colleague. Many employees asked
					me how could they help? I was personally devastated when I heard the news. <b>Dorothy was such a
						kind soul and integral to the team's success. She worked so hard and was looking forward to
						retiring soon. The immoral electric power industry is completely out of control with their price
						gouging during these tough times. </b> They should not be allowed to shut off power during these
					times and these rising prices are not sustainable for the average American family who are just
					trying to make ends meet. I will make sure to dedicate this important project not only to Dorothy's
					memory but to humanity itself. This project is so very important to us." - Josh </p>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					<b>
						<i>"After Dorothy's death, I began reading all of these reports coming out showing how the price
							of electricity has continously risen over the years in the USA and it was concerning because
							I know people are struggling to pay bills while electric company CEOs get richer. There are
							thousands of Dorothy's out there who fall behind at some point and can't afford to keep
							paying." </i>

				<p>
					<b>Of course, no one in Washington cares that the American people are being scammed</b> and the
					Public Utility Commission doesn't care to fix this crooked business of overcharging electricity to
					consumers – because they are likely benefiting from it too.
				</p>
				<h2>The Perfect Storm For Innovation...</h2>
				<p>Seeing just how devastating electricity prices are on the average American's wallet, and witnessing
					his own employee, Dorothy Smith pass away tragically, Josh set out to find his old drawing plans for
					an <b>electricity saver invention</b> he had made as a young genius in South Africa. The original
					drawing was based on a concept by his idol, legendary inventor, electrical and mechanical engineer
					and visionary, <b>Nikola Tesla.</b>
				</p>
				<p>After a few hours of digging through old papers, he found it! Josh immediately called one of his
					brightest engineers at the solar plant and trusted friend, Ed Sherwood. Combining their expertise,
					they set out to bring Josh's <b>electricity saving dream</b> to life. </p>
				<p>After a few weeks of work in a back room of the Solar Plant, they had a finished project. It was a
					source of happiness after so many weeks of sorrow mourning the death at the Solar Plant. </p>
				<div class="img">

					</a>
				</div>
				<p>Combining their experience they came up with a ground-breaking device <b>that helps you not only
						lower your electric bill, but can also increase the lifespan on expensive household
						appliances</b> because of all the energy it conserves. </p>
				<b>
					<p>They created what's being called the most important invention since the printing press! </p>
				</b>
				<p>They dubbed it, the <a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<b> StopWatt!</b>
					</a>
				</p>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">

				</div>
				<h2>How Do Power Companies Scam the Public? How Does the StopWatt Work?</h2>
				<p>StopWatt is a small, compact, affordable, and <b>easy-to-use plug-in device that stops unnecessary
						power from entering the electrical cables in your home and lowers your consumption
						instantly.</b> You just plug it in and let this smart device work it's magic. It's easy to
					connect, simply plug into the outlet closest to your breaker box. That is all you need to do, once
					plugged in the green LED indicates it is powered on and working. </p>
				<p>The fact is, all appliances draw more power than they need to run, due to inefficiencies and noise on
					the sine wave created by the electric companies to overcharge customers and scam them. <b>Power
						companies take advantage of this situation, and overcharge their customers for it. Due to their
						monopoly, the government is unwilling to step in and address this situation.</b>
				</p>
				<p>The StopWatt reduces this noise, thereby decreasing the amount of electricity used. So none is
					wasted. <b>It doesn’t change the meter reading, or steal power from anywhere else, it simply uses
						the energy more efficiently, so less is needed.</b>
				</p>
				<p>Within just 24 hours, it makes more efficient use of the total energy draw resulting in energy
					savings. <b>Your next power bill should be signifigantly lower as it becomes accustomed to the
						energy use in your home and stops excess electricity from enterting the electric cables.</b>
				</p>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<img src="3f8a0bff-0fbc-45ec-948e-0911563730ec.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b>"StopWatt is your power company's worst nightmare" says Josh.</b> They have been trying to hide
					StopWatt from the everyday consumer and have banned it in retail shops leaving it to be sold online
					only. Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.
				</p>
				<p>And something else few people are aware of is that utility companies overload circuits, which in turn
					shortens the lifespan of appliances. <b>The StopWatt helps household appliance by boosting their
						life-cycle.</b> Which means the StopWatt will quickly pay for itself. </p>
				<p>Power companies are spending millions of dollars lobbying the government to keep it off store
					shelves. Because they know it will eat deep into their massive profits, so they are fighting tooth
					and nail to keep it out of homeowner’s hands. It has become Josh's mission to make sure it enters
					every American's hands. </p>

				<h2>Putting StopWatt to the Test...</h2>
				<p>After Josh got his hands on the first prototype produced, he distibuted them for free to a private
					test group tasked with putting the StopWatt to the test and sharing their results online. </p>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<img src="ad942353-4610-4f3d-8f57-360fe161fb68.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b>Erik Dale shared his savings with us and the results were astonishing. “I don’t usually write
						reviews, but I have to share some numbers with you all… In the first month, we saved $100. By
						the second month, $185!!!. This invention only gets smarter over time and continues to save. If
						that isn’t a strong testimonial, I’m not sure what is!”</b>
				</p>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<img src="32ee2fda-5e9b-45bc-a1e5-f7c871a554f3.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>Another tester by the name of David Sansbury wrote in with his review: <b>"I’m so surprised by the
						amount we saved with these StopWatt devices… literally, you just plug them in and that’s it! My
						wife was shocked when we got our first bill and we saved $120! And it’s only gotten better from
						there… We’ll be customers for life."</b>
				</p>
				<p>With Josh's dream realized and his invention working perfectly, it was time to do some real good.
					They finalized plans to set up manufacturing through the solar plant start-up he created for
					StopWatt. In 2 weeks they had the first 100 consumer models, and set up a plan to scale up
					production and <b>get a StopWatt to everyone in the U.S. that wants or needs one by Fall 2022</b>.
				</p>
				<h2>Is It Legal And Can Big Energy Actually Stop Josh?</h2>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">
						<img src="974a280b-02c5-4c18-a591-05ff72a3f46c.jpg" style="width:100%;height:auto">
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					<b>Yes, the StopWatt is 100% legal to use.</b> There is no risk in using this amazing,
					electricity-saving device. Of course, power companies are not happy that people are using it, and
					reducing their profits. But there’s nothing they can do except try their best to keep the StopWatt
					out of as many homes as they can.
				</p>
				<p>Considering the cost savings this device can offer, many people expect it to be a big investment.
					However, that is not the case. <b>In a country wide effort to expand the awareness of StopWatt, they
						are offering our readers a limited time EXCLUSIVE DISCOUNT.</b>
				</p>
				<p>However, due to so much recent media attention and increased pressure from Big Electric, these
					money-saving tools may become impossible to find soon. And because power companies have been trying
					to hide the StopWatt from the public, many have been banned in retail shops. However, thanks to the
					Internet, the word is out and growing in awareness and use among everyday people. And they are being
					rewarded with far less power consumption, and longer-running household appliances because of all the
					energy it conserves.</p>
				<h2>What Does Josh's Invention Mean for All of Us? </h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>With Winter heating bills here, and cost of living going up, <b>the StopWatt is the cheapest and best
						way to save money on your electricity bill.</b>
				</p>
				<p>As of this Fall, Josh has delivered on his promise to make <strong>
						<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">StopWatt</a>
					</strong> available to absolutely anyone who wants one to <b>lower their electric bills for
						good</b>. With his promise comes surprising affordability too due to everything he learned
					streamlining manufacturing for Tesla. </p>
				<p>He has now launched a <strong>
						<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">website where you can get the StopWatt across the
							U.S.</a>
					</strong>, and this month, they are running a special 50% sale just to cover his cost of production.
					He wants to make sure that <b>everyone that wants to fight the electric companies and lower their
						electricity bill by up to 90% is able to.</b> But you should act now since <u>after Black Friday
						they announced they could run out any time before Christmas</u>, or before the power companies
					succeed in getting it banned. </p>
				<p>We got a hold of some of the first StopWatts and for how well they work, this is an amazing bargain
					everyone should snap up before they're sold out.</p>
				<h2>Conclusion: Is it Worth it? </h2>
				<div class="img">
					<a href="https://trk.mrttrck.com/click">

					like crazy you'll quickly see why thousands of Americans have ordered theirs already! The icing on
					the cake is the price. If it's still on promotion for under $75 - definitely, pick a few of them up
					before they're gone for good. </p>
				<p>You're probably thinking, given what this tech can do, it probably has to cost a fortune. False!
